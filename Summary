The goal of this project was to predict the price of an Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location using data from a dataset provided on Kaggle. To accomplish this task, we performed the following steps:
1.	Pre-processing the dataset: We imported the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and cleaned it by removing unnecessary columns and filling missing values. We also converted the pickup_datetime column to a datetime format and split it into separate hour, day, month, year, and dayofweek columns.
2.	Identifying and filling outliers: Outliers can negatively impact the performance of a model, so we used boxplots to visualize and identify outliers in the data. We then filled the identified outliers with the median value of the column.
3.	Checking correlation: To identify which columns might be important predictors for the fare amount, we used a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different columns in the dataset.
4.	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets: We split the cleaned and pre-processed dataset into a training set and a testing set using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This allowed us to evaluate the performance of the models on unseen data.
5.	Training and testing the linear regression model: We used the training set to fit a linear regression model to the data and then made predictions on the testing set using the model. We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as R2 and RMSE.
6.	Training and testing the random forest regression model: We followed a similar process to train and test a random forest regression model on the data.
7.	Comparing the performance of the two models: We compared the performance of the linear regression model and the random forest regression model using the evaluation metrics calculated earlier (R2 and RMSE). The model with the higher R2 score and lower RMSE was generally considered to be the better model.
8.	Fine-tuning the chosen model: If necessary, we fine-tuned the chosen model by adjusting its hyperparameters or using different features from the dataset. This helped improve its performance.
9.	Making predictions with the model: Once we had a trained and fine-tuned model, we used it to make predictions about the fare amount for a given pickup location and drop-off location.
Overall, this project demonstrated how to use machine learning techniques to predict the price of an Uber ride based on various factors such as the pickup location, drop-off location, and time of day. We were able to successfully train and test two different regression models on the data and compare their performance to determine the best fit for the data. We also fine-tuned the chosen model to improve its performance and used it to make predictions about the fare amount for a given pickup location and drop-off location.
By following the steps outlined in this project, we were able to build a model that can predict the price of an Uber ride with a certain level of accuracy. This type of model can be useful for riders who want to estimate the cost of their ride before requesting a trip, and for Uber drivers who want to optimize their routes to maximize their earnings.
