Predicting the Price of an Uber Ride
The goal of this project is to predict the price of an Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location using data from a dataset provided on Kaggle.

Prerequisites
Python 3
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Usage
To run the code in this project, clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the code. Then, run the following command:

Copy code
python predict_uber_fare.py
The code will pre-process the dataset, train and test both a linear regression model and a random forest regression model, fine-tune the chosen model, and make predictions with the model. The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics such as R2 and RMSE.

Data
The data for this project is provided in the uber.csv file, which contains information about the pickup location, drop-off location, and fare amount for a number of Uber rides. The data has been pre-processed to remove unnecessary columns and fill missing values.

Methodology
To predict the price of an Uber ride, we followed the following steps:

Pre-processing the dataset: We cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and filling missing values. We also converted the pickup_datetime column to a datetime format and split it into separate hour, day, month, year, and dayofweek columns.

Identifying and filling outliers: We used boxplots to visualize and identify outliers in the data, and then filledChecking correlation: We used a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different columns in the dataset and identify which columns might be important predictors for the fare amount.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets: We split the cleaned and pre-processed dataset into a training set and a testing set using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This allowed us to evaluate the performance of the models on unseen data.

Training and testing the linear regression model: We used the training set to fit a linear regression model to the data and then made predictions on the testing set using the model. We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as R2 and RMSE.

Training and testing the random forest regression model: We followed a similar process to train and test a random forest regression model on the data.

Comparing the performance of the two models: We compared the performance of the linear regression model and the random forest regression model using the evaluation metrics calculated earlier (R2 and RMSE). The model with the higher R2 score and lower RMSE was generally considered to be the better model.

Fine-tuning the chosen model: If necessary, we fine-tuned the chosen model by adjusting its hyperparameters or using different features from the dataset. This helped improve its performance.

Making predictions with the model: Once we had a trained and fine-tuned model, we used it to make predictions about the fare amount for a given pickup location and drop-off location.

Results
Using the methods described above, we were able to build a model that can predict the price of an Uber ride with a certain level of accuracy. This type of model can be useful for riders who want to estimate the cost of their ride before requesting a trip, and for Uber drivers who want to optimize their routes to maximize their earnings.
